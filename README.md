# Scheduling App (Full Stack)

Scheduling app built using React, Express and MongoDB. The application allows for user sign up, login (with authentication), and user actions including adding events, updating events, deleting events and filtering events. The app also lets users change their username.

### About this project

This was my first full stack project. The brief was to create a scheduling app with an Express.js server and a MongoDB database. The brief stated users should be able to signup to an account with a username and password, login in to their account with built-in authentication, and create, remove and update events. I also added features to let users filter events listed in the app, favourite events, and update their username.
